Question 1: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/AwQrGQhGX For this question I created a backgorund and brown ground for my sprite to stand on.
Then I created a smiley face using simple shapes and using translate and mouseX I made the sprite follow my curser on the X axis as it goes across the screen.

Question 2: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/CwUZ_SAgn. In this question I codded the sprite to blink its eyes when the mouse is clicked.
