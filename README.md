Question 1: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/AwQrGQhGX For this question I created a backgorund and brown ground for my sprite to stand on.
Then I created a smiley face using simple shapes and using translate and mouseX I made the sprite follow my curser on the X axis as it goes across the screen.

Question 2: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/CwUZ_SAgn. In this question I codded the sprite to blink its eyes when the mouse is clicked.

Question 3: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/clhVJIyKt. In this question the task was to add a sprite dropper once you ran the code. for my sprite I created a simple orange for my face to catch. I set the paratmeters of the orange to spawn from x 10 to x 390 and the speed can range from anywhere from 3 to 7.  

Question 4: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/LeS65L5Hs.  For this part, the task was to make the falling sprite appear when you clicked on the mouse, not when you begin to run the program. For this I added a mouse is pressed function and added a dropOrange variable to make the orange fall when I called it.  Also, in the Draw orange function I added parameters to where the orange can fall so that when it hits the ground it disappears and resets so I can call the orange again by clicking down on the mouse. But I also had to call my OrangeX variable again for It to spawn at different locations but I was not sure as to why becasue I had already called it earlier in my code. But the code only works if I have it in there twice.
