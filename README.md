Question 1: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/AwQrGQhGX For this question I created a backgorund and brown ground for my sprite to stand on.
Then I created a smiley face using simple shapes and using translate and mouseX I made the sprite follow my curser on the X axis as it goes across the screen.


Question 2: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/CwUZ_SAgn. In this question I codded the sprite to blink its eyes when the mouse is clicked.

Question 3: https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/clhVJIyKt. In this question the task was to add a sprite dropper once you ran the code. for my sprite I created a simple orange for my face to catch. I set the paratmeters of the orange to spawn from x 10 to x 390 and the speed can range from anywhere from 3 to 7.
